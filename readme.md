The folder HKD-SHO contains the code for the paper: HKD-SHO: A hybrid smart home system based on knowledge-based and data-driven services. It includes the codes for the following five systems:

1. HKD-SHO: proposed hybrid system

2. HKD-SHO without extracted rules: the HKD-SHO system without the modules concerning the extracted rules.

3. HKD-SHO without existing rules: the HKD-SHO system without the modules concerning the existing rules.

4. SHOMA: multiagent hybrid system containing only the machine learning based reasoner.

5. Random: the random system where each service randomly proposed actuators' states while the shared actuators' states are determined by respecting either EPbA or RSAbA principle.
