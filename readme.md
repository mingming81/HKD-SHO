The codes are for the paper: HKD-SHO: A hybrid smart home system based on knowledge-based and data-driven services, where

1. HKD-SHO: the proposed hybrid system

2. HKD-SHO without existing rules: HKD-SHO without modules concerning the existing rules

3. HKD-SHO without extracted rules: HKD-SHO without modules concerning the extracted rules

4. SHOMA: multiagent reinforcement learning architectures corresponding to the machine learning-based system in HKD-SHO

5. Random: random system where services randomly propose actuators' states
